# titanic_survival_exploration

In this project, decision functions were created to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster. Different features of the passenger like age, sex, class etc were analyzed for this model.
Initially a simple algorithm was developed and then the complexity of this algorithm was increased to improve efficiency of the algorithm. An efficiency of 80.36% was achieved to predict the survival outcomes of the passengers.
This project contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file where all the work for the project is performed.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The project dataset. You?ll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.
